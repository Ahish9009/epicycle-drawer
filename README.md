# Epicycle Drawer

## Introduction
This is a tool that takes in a drawing as input from the user and draws it using epicycles.
### What are epicycles and epicycle drawings?
An epicycle is a circle, with a small radius, whose center revolves on the circumference of another circle of larger radius. The path traced by a point on the smaller circle can be manipulated to form various different shapes. This is demonstrated in the image below.

Multiple circles can be arranged and made to rotate at different speeds and in different phases. The path of a point on the last such circle can be traced, to create a drawing. The aim of this project is to take a desired drawing as input, and arrange circles in such a way that the path of a point on the last circle results in the desired drawing.
